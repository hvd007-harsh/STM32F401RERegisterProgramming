## Introduction

KEIL MDK (Microcontroller Development Kit) is a powerful integrated development environment for microcontroller applications. Register-level programming involves direct interaction with a microcontroller's hardware registers to control and configure its peripherals and core functionalities.

This guide will cover the fundamentals of register-level programming with KEIL MDK and provide examples to get you started.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into register-level programming, ensure you have a good understanding of microcontroller architectures and the specific microcontroller you're working with. Familiarize yourself with the datasheet and reference manual of your microcontroller.

## Environment Setup

To get started with KEIL MDK:

1. Download and install KEIL MDK from the official website.
2. Set up your project in KEIL MDK, including selecting your target microcontroller.
3. Configure your project settings, including compiler options, linker settings, and debug options.

## Project Structure

This repository provides a basic project structure for register-level programming with KEIL MDK:

```
